# Python implementation of Grabcut and Poisson Blending
### Made use of several python libraries, however the implementation is made manually instead of being used via a library (i.e OpenCV).
### The implementation was based on the original research paper and another paper on the implementation of Grabcut algorithm .
### The project includes data for tests and ground truth for grabcut and an implementation for calculating accuracy and jaccard according to the ground truth.
